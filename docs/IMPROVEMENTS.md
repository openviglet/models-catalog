# Model Catalog — Design rationale (IMPROVEMENTS)

> The *what/why* for **unshipped** sections only. No status tables, no shipped
> implementation reports (those live in `git log` + [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
> Status lives only in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

> **Guardrails these all respect.** **Zero npm dependency** (Node built-ins + inline
> HTML/CSS/JS only), no runtime / server-side query, propose-and-review only, and no
> envelope-shape break (`version` stays `1` — new fields optional and additive). Pricing
> is now in scope but **bounded** to an *indicative US list price* (STRATEGY §I, reversed
> by Block F). Consumer artifacts stay *derived* from the canonical file at emit time, so
> they can never drift from the source of truth.

## §G — Static-site expansion & citability

The catalog's **cite/reference** job is served by static, crawlable, JS-free pages emitted
from the canonical JSON — the durable counterpart to the interactive Explore SPA (§L). The
scalable path is to **extend the zero-dep `emit.mjs` generator**, not adopt a framework:
Next.js was weighed and rejected because it would break the foundational zero-dependency
bet to solve a problem the emit path already solves (generating static files from a JSON is
a loop, not a framework need). The seam with §L is deliberate and load-bearing: the SPA owns
*interactivity* (filter / sort / compare over the live dataset); these pages own *citability*
(one model, one segment — linkable, indexable, provenance-first). The drawer is the bridge —
a preview that always links out to the durable per-model page.

### §G1 — T34 · Per-segment hubs + sitemap
Reframed from "more landing pages" into real **per-segment hubs**: per-capability /
per-modality / per-kind (and per-tier) pages that are each a compact **static leaderboard**
(the top models in that segment, pre-sorted, cross-linked to per-model pages) + a short prose
intro + links to the matching JSON slice and to Explore pre-filtered to that segment — *not*
a bare link list. Plus `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt` so every hub and per-model page is
crawlable. Serves humans and assistants/crawlers at once; derived-at-emit, zero-dep, no
framework. (This is the "reference/cite" backbone of the §L information architecture, no
longer an SEO side-quest.)

### §G2 — T58 · First-class per-model page
Today a model's depth lives only in the transient SPA drawer and a minimal, differently-styled
emitted table — there is no durable, well-laid-out, citable page, which is the thing a reference
site most needs. Promote the emitted page to a first-class, scannable reference: a header
(vendor / kind / use-case tags / tier / open-weights), an **at-a-glance stat strip** (context,
max output, price, one headline benchmark, throughput — only tiles that carry data),
populated-only sections (pricing / benchmarks incl. per-domain scores / performance / identity /
capabilities, each with its cited caveat + `source` + `lastVerified`), an **always-visible
provenance block** (the trust anchor on a citable page), and derived **related models** (same
vendor + kind neighbours, tier above/below — a loop at emit, zero-dep). Style it with the SPA's
design **tokens** so hub → page → drawer read as one system (today the static page is a jarring
separate mini-stylesheet). Sparse-aware by *omitting* empty sections (a low-data model looks
intentional, not broken) — unlike the drawer/compare, which show "—" for alignment. The drawer
stays as the in-context preview and gains an "Open full page ↗" link. Evolves T26.

## §L — Explore & decide: catalog data experience

The catalog outgrew its container. Rich per-model data (pricing, cited benchmarks + per-domain
scores, cited speed, open-weights/parameters, classification) across ~240 models now sits behind
a Browse surface that still presents a **vendor-grouped inventory** — and sorting happens *within*
each vendor group, so the cross-vendor questions the catalog is uniquely able to answer ("cheapest
chat model overall", "biggest context window", "best intelligence-per-dollar") are literally
impossible in the UI. Meanwhile the home page is accreting analytics bands (Insights, Coverage,
Plans, Sources) above Browse — the "hyper-page with everything" to avoid. This block turns the site
from an **inventory** into a **decision tool**, organised around three jobs — **orient** (what/why
+ how to consume), **explore/decide** (find & compare across the whole dataset), **cite** (durable
per-model / per-segment pages, §G) — each with its own surface so no single screen carries
everything.

**Foundational principle — the site is the reference consumer of the JS SDK.** The page must stop
hand-rolling `fetch("./catalog.json")` and instead consume `@openviglet/model-catalog-client` (the
Block B/K SDK), loaded as a static ESM module (no build, no CDN, still zero-dep). This makes the
site the real-world acceptance test for the SDK: any gap the Explore rework hits — a missing loader,
an untyped field, an unexposed slice — is fixed **in the SDK** (feeding Block K: T47 aggregate
loaders, T48 faceted-slice / change-feed accessors), never worked around in the page.

**Honesty under sparsity is a design constraint, not an afterthought.** Benchmarks are populated on
~14% of models, performance ~8%, pricing ~86%; three advertised fields (`knowledgeCutoff`,
`releaseDate`, `status`), `benchmarks.arenaElo` and the `reasoning` score domain are 0% filled.
Dense facts drive the defaults; sparse facts are opt-in overlays that always print their denominator
("32 of 182 chat models with a cited score") and never null-fill, plot, or invent — consistent with
the provenance-first bet. All views keep the existing framing: tier is a *price proxy, not a quality
verdict*; every benchmark/speed number is *cited — verify at the source*.

### §L6 — T55 · IA re-layout (orient / explore / cite)
Stop the hyper-page slide: home becomes **orient only** (hero + a tight "what's inside" strip + a
prominent Explore entry + API / SDKs / Contribute); the analytics bands (Insights charts, Coverage
heatmap, Plans, Sources) move **off the critical path** into one addressable, tabbed analytics home
(Overview · Coverage · Plans · Sources), trimming the nav from eight bands toward four. Browse/Explore
stays the single primary interactive surface. Pure information architecture — no new data.

### §L7 — T56 · Facet rail + shareable presets
Replace the tall stacked facet wall with a grouped, collapsible **facet rail** carrying per-chip
match counts, an "N active · clear all" summary, and labelled AND/OR semantics — so filtering has
real scent and dead-end empty states get rarer. Add a **"copy link to this view"** action over the
existing URL-state and ship a handful of curated **preset** links (e.g. "Frontier reasoning",
"Open-weight ≥ 70B", "Cheapest long-context chat", "Embeddings by dimension"). Exploratory (💭):
preset curation + rail layout want a design pass. Depends on the flat table (T51) + columns (T52).

### §L8 — T57 · Mobile & render performance
Restore usable **mobile navigation** (today every nav link is hidden < 720px, leaving only ⌘K +
theme) via a compact menu, add a **card view** < 720px (an 8-column horizontally-scrolling table is
hostile on a phone), and **debounce the keystroke re-render** (Browse currently rebuilds the whole
table DOM on every keypress — fine at 240 models, laggy well before it breaks). Exploratory (💭):
the mobile IA + card layout want a design pass.
