# Model Catalog — Design rationale (IMPROVEMENTS)

> The *what/why* for **unshipped** sections only. No status tables, no shipped
> implementation reports (those live in `git log` + [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
> Status lives only in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## §I Extended self-hosted / aggregator sources (T4)

The shipped pipeline anchors ids from five cloud vendors' live listing APIs plus
LiteLLM enrichment. The non-cloud rows (`ollama`, `bedrock`, `vertex-ai`) currently
have no *authoritative* live source in the pipeline — they survive only via
carry-forward + LiteLLM, which cannot introduce new ids (the anchoring rule). Add
sources behind the existing `SourceAdapter` contract:

- **Ollama** — the public library index + a local `ollama list` for what's actually
  pulled; kind from the model family.
- **Bedrock** — `ListFoundationModels` (AWS SDK / signed request); maps provider +
  modalities onto the taxonomy.
- **HuggingFace** — for local ONNX embedding models, resolve dimensions + metadata
  from the model card / config.

Each is opt-in and key/credential-gated exactly like the cloud adapters (missing
credential → skip, never fail). This closes the anchoring gap for self-hosted rows.

## §II Opt-in CI regeneration → PR (T5)

A manual-dispatch GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm run regen` with API keys
from CI secrets and **opens a pull request** carrying the regenerated
`catalog/models-catalog.json` + the diff report as the PR body. This automates the
*fetch*, not the *decision*: the workflow never runs `--apply` on `main` and never
auto-merges — a human reviews the diff (conflicts, removals, adds) and merges. This
preserves the propose-and-review discipline (a bad upstream fetch can only ever
become a reviewable PR, never a silent publish). Distinct from the existing
**Publish** workflow, which only emits the *already-committed* canonical file to
Pages and never touches upstream.

## §III Branded custom domain for the endpoint (T6)

The endpoint currently lives at the GitHub Pages default
(`openviglet.github.io/models-catalog`). A branded domain (e.g. `models.viglet.org`)
is friendlier for external consumers and decouples the public URL from the repo
name. Add a `public/CNAME`, set `CATALOG_SOURCE_URL` at emit time so the envelope's
`$schema`/`source` + the docs point at the branded host, and update Turing's
`turing.models-catalog.url` default. Because the URL is outward-facing and external
consumers may pin it, keep the old Pages URL resolving (redirect) for a deprecation
window.
