# Model Catalog — Design rationale (IMPROVEMENTS)

> The *what/why* for **unshipped** sections only. No status tables, no shipped
> implementation reports (those live in `git log` + [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
> Status lives only in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

> **Guardrails these all respect.** **Zero npm dependency** (Node built-ins + inline
> HTML/CSS/JS only), no runtime / server-side query, propose-and-review only, and no
> envelope-shape break (`version` stays `1` — new fields optional and additive). Pricing
> is now in scope but **bounded** to an *indicative US list price* (STRATEGY §I, reversed
> by Block F). Consumer artifacts stay *derived* from the canonical file at emit time, so
> they can never drift from the source of truth.

> _No unshipped sections — the backlog is currently clear. When a new task needs
> design rationale, add its section here (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for status)._
