# Last task number — `T6` · next block letter — `B`

> **Single source of truth for the next free task number.** The next new task is
> `T7`; after assigning it, bump the number above and the log line below.
>
> T-numbers are **non-contiguous across blocks** — never infer the next number
> from a block's header range or a `git log` scan. This counter is authoritative.
> The block letter has the same hazard: **`CHANGELOG.md` is authoritative for the
> real maximum block**, not `ROADMAP.md` (which lists only unshipped work).

## Rule

1. **Before creating a task**, read the number above and use `T<n+1>`.
2. **After creating it**, increment the number above and append a log line below.
3. Never infer the next number from a block header range or a `git log` scan.
4. **Before creating a new block**, use the next block letter above; confirm the
   real maximum by grepping `CHANGELOG.md`, then bump the letter after creating it.
